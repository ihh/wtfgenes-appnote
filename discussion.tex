We have provided a static site generator for ontological term enrichment analysis, offering both Bayesian and frequentist tests.
Static sites are, in general, cheaper and more secure than running code on a server.

Model-based TEA is versatile: it can readily be extended
to allow for datasets that are structured
temporally \citep{pmid26111374},
spatially \citep{pmid26877824},
or by genomic region \citep{pmid20436461};
to use domain-specific biological knowledge \citep{pmid24675718};
or to incorporate additional lines of evidence such as quantitative data \citep{pmid21599902}.
We hope our development of a collapsed likelihood, and evaluation of different MCMC kernels, will assist these efforts.

Coincidentally, Fisher's Exact Test---which we call Frequentist TEA---was originally motivated by a blind tea-tasting challenge \citep{Fisher1935}.
