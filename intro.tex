Term Enrichment Analysis (TEA) is a common technique for finding functional patterns,
specifically over-represented ontology terms, in a set of experimentally identified genes \citep{pmid15297299}.
The most common approach,
which we refer to as {\em Frequentist TEA},
is a one-tailed Fisher's Exact Test (based on the hypergeometric distribution,
which models the number of term-associations if the gene set was chosen by chance),
with a suitable correction for multiple hypothesis testing.
Frequentist TEA has been implemented many times on various platforms \citep{pmid12431279,pmid11829497,pmid12702209,pmid15297299,pmid18511468,pmid22543366,pmid23868073,pmid23586463}.

A model-based alternative to Frequentist TEA, which more directly addresses multiple testing issues
(for example, by modeling the partitioning of an observed gene set by complementary terms),
is {\em Bayesian TEA}.
In contrast to Frequentist TEA, which just rejects a null hypothesis that genes are chosen by chance,
Bayesian TEA explicitly models the alternative hypothesis that the gene set was generated by a few random ontology terms.
This approach was introduced by \cite{pmid18676451}, developed by \cite{pmid20172960},
and implemented in Java and R \citep{pmid21561920}.
However, the model-based approach remains significantly less well-explored than Frequentist TEA.

Most Bayesian and Frequentist TEA implementations are designed for desktop use.
Several Frequentist TEA implementations are designed for the web, such as
DAVID-WS \citep{pmid22543366} and
Enrichr \citep{pmid23586463} % \citep{pmid23586463,pmid25971742,pmid27141961}
which has a rich dynamic web front-end.
However, these generally require a server-hosted back end that executes code.
Further, there are no web-based Bayesian TEA implementations.
