Our JavaScript software, when used as a web application,
offers a ``quick report'' view using Frequentist TEA.
For the slower-running but more powerful Bayesian TEA, the software plots the log-likelihood during an MCMC sampling run, for visual feedback.
The repository includes setup scripts allowing the tool to be deployed as a ``static site'',
i.e. consisting only of static files (HTML, CSS, JSON, and JavaScript) that can be hosted via a minimal web server with no need for dynamic code execution.

An example \wtfgenes\ static site, configured for the GO-basic ontology and GO-annotated genomes from the Gene Ontology website,
can be found at \url{https://evoldoers.github.io/wtfgo}.
